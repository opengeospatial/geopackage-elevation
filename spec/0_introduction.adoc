== Introduction

A GeoPackage <<geopackage>> is a platform-independent SQLite <<sqlite>> database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables.
GeoPackage is designed to be extensible, including support for additional data types.

This document defines extensions that allow GeoPackage to support elevation data. Elevation data is provided as tiles of PNG or TIFF files,
using 16 bit signed integer and 32 bit floating point data formats. To support this, an ancillary data table is used.
