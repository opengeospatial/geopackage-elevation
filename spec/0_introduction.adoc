== Introduction

A GeoPackage <<geopackage>> is a platform-independent SQLite <<sqlite>> database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables.
GeoPackage is designed to be extensible, including support for additional data types.

This document defines extensions that allow GeoPackage to support elevation data. Elevation data is provided as tiles of 16 bit unsigned integer PNG files.
An additional extension allows the use of TIFF files containing 32 bit floating point data. To support this, an ancillary data table is used.
